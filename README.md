# Sales Analysis and Forecasting for E-Commerce Platforms

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance e-commerce platform performance by leveraging sales data to identify trends, predict future sales, and support merchants in crafting effective strategies. Using historical data from May 2016 to April 2019, this analysis combines machine learning, time series modeling, and statistical methods to deliver actionable insights.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises sales data across various clothing categories. Features include:
- **S (Sales)**: Sales volume (unit: billion Yuan)
- **X4**: Page views (unit: billion)
- **X8**: Additional purchases (unit: 10 million)
- **X9**: Customer group index (unit: 100 thousand)
- **X10**: Transaction index (unit: million)

## Key Analyses
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removal of duplicates and handling of missing values using imputation.
2. **Outlier Detection**
   - Identification of outliers through boxplots and Z-scores.
3. **Feature Scaling**
   - Standardized features using Z-score normalization for consistent scaling.
4. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Explored inter-feature relationships via heatmaps and scatter plots.
5. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
   - Dimensionality reduction to simplify the dataset while retaining over 95% of the variance.
6. **Time Series Decomposition**
   - Analyzed and visualized trends, seasonality, and residuals in the sales data.
7. **Prediction Models**
   - Implemented **Linear Regression** for feature-based predictions.
   - Developed **Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing** for capturing seasonal trends.
   - Built **ARIMA models** for advanced time series forecasting.
8. **Custom Predictions**
   - Designed functionality to predict sales for a specific date and category based on given features.
   
## Results
- The **Linear Regression** model delivered high RÂ² values across categories, reflecting accurate feature-based predictions.
- **Holt-Winters** effectively captured seasonal variations in sales data.
- **ARIMA** demonstrated robust forecasting for future sales, following careful parameter tuning.
- Comprehensive visualization highlighted trends, outliers, and predicted versus actual sales.

## Visualizations
The notebook includes:
- Detailed boxplots for outlier detection.
- Heatmaps to examine feature correlations.
- Decomposition plots showcasing trends and seasonality.
- Forecasting charts comparing predictions to actual sales data.
